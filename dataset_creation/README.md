The files in this folder provide code and examples for dataset creation, including:
1. Downloading subsets of the raw camera images from [our repository on NERSC](https://portal.nersc.gov/project/m3795/hrtem-generalization/)
2. Converting raw camera images into datasets for machine learning, which includes code for pixel rescaling, image patch creation, and flat field correction
