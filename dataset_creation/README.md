The files in this folder provide code and examples for dataset creation, including:
1. Downloading subsets of the raw camera images from [our repository on NERSC](https://portal.nersc.gov/project/m3795/hrtem-generalization/)
2. Converting raw camera images into datasets for machine learning, which includes code for pixel rescaling, image patch creation, and flat field correction

To be added - accessing our raw data via Foundry-ML

If interested in using this data for your own research, please cite the following DOIs depending on data usage:
1. If only using the raw camera images: doi.org/10.18126/z4mr-xwk5 (Foundry-ML)
2. If using the post-processed, curated datasets using our preprocessing: doi.org/10.7941/D1SP93 (Dryad Depository)
