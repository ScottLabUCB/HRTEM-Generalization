The files in this folder provide code and examples for dataset creation, including:
1. Downloading subsets of the raw camera images from [our repository on NERSC](https://portal.nersc.gov/project/m3795/hrtem-generalization/)
2. Converting raw camera images into datasets for machine learning, which includes code for pixel rescaling, image patch creation, and flat field correction

If interested in using this data for your own research, please cite the following DOIs depending on data usage:
1. If only using the raw camera images: (DOI HERE)
2. If using the post-processed, curated datasets using our preprocessing: (DOI HERE)
